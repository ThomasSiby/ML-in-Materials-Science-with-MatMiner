# ML-in-Materials-Science-with-MatMiner
This repository explains how to run simple machine learning models using matminer and scikit-learn. 
To run the files, you need to have your own (preferably) Materials Project API key (https://materialsproject.org/api) and that can be generated using the Materials Project credentials (https://materialsproject.org/).
